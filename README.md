Project Objective:

Build a dynamic and visually appealing blog website that empowers you to create, manage, and publish content easily. Collaborate effectively with your partner on GitHub to maintain a well-structured codebase and achieve a seamless user experience across different devices.

Design and Content:

Homepage: Clear and engaging banner showcasing the blog's theme . List of recent blog posts with informative snippets (title, featured image, excerpt). Navigation bar for easy access to other sections (About, Contact, etc.).

Blog Post: Compelling title and author information. Well-structured content with clear headers and paragraphs. Embedded images and media (if applicable). Social media sharing buttons. Comments section for reader interaction ( consider JavaScript for dynamic comments).

Other Pages: Create additional pages as needed (About, Contact, etc.). Maintain consistency in navigation and overall design.

Responsive Behavior: Implement media queries using CSS to adapt the website's layout for various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile). Ensure optimal readability and user experience across devices. Test responsiveness thoroughly using browser developer tools or emulators.

Additional Considerations:

Accessibility: Emphasize web accessibility by using semantic HTML, appropriate ARIA attributes, and clear color contrast. Use comments within the code to clarify your approach and decisions. Note: Commit changes when you are satisfied, and push with a message attached

Additional Tips:

Branching: Consider using branches to isolate different features or bug fixes. Create a new branch using git branch <branch_name> and switch to it using git checkout <branch_name>. Merging: Once you're ready to incorporate changes from a branch into the main branch, use git merge <branch_name>. Rebasing: If you want to clean up your commit history and reapply changes on top of a different commit, use git rebase <base_commit>. Pull Requests: For collaborative projects, use GitHub's pull requests to propose changes and get feedback before merging them into the main branch.
